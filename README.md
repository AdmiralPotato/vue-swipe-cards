# vue-swipe-cards
A Vue.js 2 component to enable horizontal scrolling of cards with focus on mobile performance

Uses ES6 flavor variable declarations and multiline string templates, and is unapologetic about being dismissive of the compiled JavaScript ecosystem.

Your browser/webView must be ES6 tall to ride this ride.

###Demo

####Usage
You'll probably want the styles:

```<link rel="stylesheet" src="vue-swipe-cards.css">```

Then, after you've already loaded Vue, perhaps you'll do something like this:

```<script src="vue-swipe-cards.js"></script>```
